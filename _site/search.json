    "text": "As a behavioral ecologist my interests focus strongly on interactions between individual animals and their competitors and predators. I’m interested in how humans can reshape ecological webs through changes in animal behavior and how we can mitigate these effects to better coexist with wildlife.\nFEAR ECOLOGY\nFear of predators can strongly affect animal decision-making. Most recently I tested ABRs with Andy Allan (Leverhulme Research Fellow, Durham University) to investigate whether the colonization of the large northeastern coyote has maintained a fear of canids where Algonquin wolves are now extirpated in the Adirondack mountains of NY.\n\n\n\nA large northeastern coyote in the Huntington Wildlife Forest (a part of SUNY-ESF) in Newcomb, NY\n\n\nIn South Africa, my work with samango monkeys focused heavily on their spatial, behavioral, and physiological responses to predators like crowned eagles and leopards. I conducted field experiments with recorded video (LaBarge et al. 2021, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology) and used GPS data to investigate if animals avoided areas where they had previously encountered predators and if they behaved as a more spatially cohesive group upon returning to ‘dangerous’ places (LaBarge et al. 2020, Animal Behavior). I also found evidence that humans are modulating these fear responses and that our presence may be limiting these natural encounters (LaBarge et al. 2022, Hormones and Behavior)\n\nINDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR\nWildlife populations are made up of heterogeneous individuals who differ in traits such as body size, reproductive status, age, behavioural tendencies (e.g., due to latent personality traits), and sex. The role inter-individual variation plays in predator community interactions has been studied in micro/mesocosms, but less so for animals inhabiting natural environments. While some research does show that many individual predators specialise in certain prey species, most wildlife research still overlooks how phenotypic variation might impact natural behavioural patterns and ecological dynamics. Within-species phenotypic and behavioural diversity may also help explain variation in individuals’ abilities to be resilient to human presence and rapid environmental change. I’m especially interested in how individual traits can lead to individuals fulfilling distinct ecological roles (see: “Keystone Individuals - – linking predator traits to community ecology” in Trends in Ecology and Evolution). This work is conducted in collaboration with Andy Allan of Durham University.\n\n\n\nAlong with more commonly considered individual traits (e.g., body size and reproductive status), specific personality traits should govern individual behavior, including interactions with other species.\n\n\nSOCIAL LIVING AND VIOLENT INTERGROUP CONFLICT\nLiving in a social group can provide individuals with safety and foraging benefits - but also comes with substantial costs. Sometimes individual interests conflict with the group (e.g., decisions of when to forage, rest, etc.) and in other cases, conflict within a group or between social groups can threaten individual survival and future reproductive success. Violent extra-group encounters can be particularly dangerous in certain species so the maintenance of these behaviours across diverse taxa is still largely a mystery. i am now working on these questions with Michael Cant’s group at the University of Exeter Centre for Ecology and Conservation at his long-term field site in Uganda’s Queen Elizabeth National Park."

    "text": "Laura LaBarge is a postdoctoral scientist with the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University in Exeter. Based in Cornwall, England, Laura’s research is focused on wildlife living in remote places. She currently conducts fieldwork in the Queen Elizabeth National Park on the long-term banded mongoose project in western Uganda. She spent years living in the Soutpansberg mountains of South Africa in the Afromontane mist-belt forests working with Durham University’s (UK) Primate and Predator Project based in a remote mountainous area north of Louis Trichardt (Makhado), Limpopo. Laura conducted her PhD research on site with sporatic teaching assignments in New York. During the pandemic she then worked remotely in collaboration with two NGOs - the Centre for Conservation Innovation at Defenders of Wildlife and Panthera - to investigate the keystone and ecosystem engineer roles of mountain lions (puma) across the Americas. In 2021 she then moved to Germany to work as a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz. In 2024 she moved to the UK but continued as an MPI Guest Scientist and conducted research in the Adirondack mountains of New York. She holds a BSc in Biology from SUNY-ESF with a minor in Applied Statistics.\nOutside of work I love painting (acrylic or oil), reading and hoarding books, weightlifting, and long-distance hiking (especially mountains)\n\nEXPERIENCE\nUniversity of Exeter | Centre for Ecology and Conservation | Cornwall UK & QENP Uganda | Postdoc 2025-\nMax Planck Institute of Animal Behavior | Guest Scientist | 2024\nMax Planck Institute of Animal Behavior | Postdoctoral Scientist | Konstanz DE | 2021-23\nCentre for Conservation Innovation & Dept. of Field Conservation | Defenders of Wildlife | Affiliate (remote) | 2020\nState University of New York | PhD Candidate & Presidential Fellow | Amherst NY & Makhado South Africa | 2016-21\nDurham University | Primate and Predator Project | Field Research Assistant | Lajuma Research Centre Makhado South Africa | 2015\nRosamond Gifford Zoo | Education Programs Animal Keeper | Syracuse NY USA | 2011-2014 (half year)\nSUNY-ESF | Ranavirus Disease Ecology Project | Tully Memorial Forest NY USA | Field Assistant | 2014 (part-time)\nThe State University of New York | College of Environmental Science and Forestry | BSc in Biology major concentration in Conservation Biology & minor in Applied Statistics | 2011-2015\nContact: lrlabarge@gmail.com\nPronouns: She/her; US Citizen & UK visa-holder\nAWARDS/FUNDING\n2016-2020 Presidential Fellowship, College of Arts & Sciences, SUNY, University at Buffalo $30K\n2018 L.
