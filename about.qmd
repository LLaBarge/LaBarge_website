Laura LaBarge is a postdoctoral scientist with the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University in Exeter. Based in Cornwall, England, Laura's research is focused on wildlife living in remote places. She currently conducts fieldwork in the Queen Elizabeth National Park on the long-term banded mongoose project in western Uganda. She spent years living in the Soutpansberg mountains of South Africa in the Afromontane mist-belt forests working with Durham University's (UK) Primate and Predator Project based in a remote mountainous area north of Louis Trichardt (Makhado), Limpopo. Laura conducted her PhD research on site with sporatic teaching assignments in New York. During the pandemic she then worked remotely in collaboration with two NGOs - the Centre for Conservation Innovation at Defenders of Wildlife and Panthera - to investigate the keystone and ecosystem engineer roles of mountain lions (puma) across the Americas. In 2021 she then moved to Germany to work as a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz. In 2024 she moved to the UK but continued as an MPI Guest Scientist and conducted research in the Adirondack mountains of New York. She holds a BSc in Biology from SUNY-ESF with a minor in Applied Statistics.

Outside of work I love painting (acrylic or oil), reading and hoarding books, weightlifting, and long-distance hiking (especially mountains)
